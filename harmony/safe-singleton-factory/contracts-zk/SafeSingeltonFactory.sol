/**
 * The purpose of this contract is to provide a factory that deterministically deploys arbitrary contracts.
 * The advantage is that once such a contract has been deployed and verified, deployment flows can be 
 * easily reproduced in a deterministic way. This removed centralization (reliance on a specific deployment key)
 * and improves security (as it is easy to verify deployed code).
 * The factory should follow the same pattern as https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy:
 * - `to` of a transaction has to be adjusted to the factory contract address
 * - `salt` (bytes32) is by prepended to the deployment data
